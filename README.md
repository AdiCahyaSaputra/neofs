A file manager for neovim

## Initial Ideas

The idea is that it runs in neovim without any dependencies.

Given the following ranger example:

The file manager itself lives in a floating window, while every tab would be a seperate window.

Support a view like nnn/netrw where you only see a list of the current directory would also be cool to support.

Maybe you configure this using a config value?

The file manager uses intuitive keybindings that are easy to access, to make using the file manager a pleasure.
